# OpenTrafficSim version 1

## What is OpenTrafficSim?

### Project overview

OpenTrafficSim aims to bring traffic simulation to a new level by
* Combining micro-simulation, macro-simulation and meta-simulation in a single environment
* Combining all traffic modes (private car, buses, trains, bicycles, pedestrians, airlines, etc.) in a single simulator
* Providing options to link to external code, driving simulators, and data sources
We bring together state of the art simulation techniques, software development techniques and the best people in the traffic, simulation and software fields.

### Open source

Everything in OpenTrafficSim shall have a BSD, Apache, MIT, or similar open source license ensuring that
* OpenTrafficSim can be incorporated in part or in full in other products for any use (educational, commercial, whatever)
* OpenTrafficSim may be extended, evolved into anything else for any purpose
